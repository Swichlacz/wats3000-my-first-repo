Benten Island

 

“Such a lovely island—
seems a shame for it to be out there,
so I’ll just snag it with a rope
and take it away.”

 

So laughed a sailor from the North.

 

He’s lying, he’s lying, I thought.
But as night grew darker, I began to worry.

 

And in the morning, with my heart racing
I ran to the beach.

 

Benten Island was still there
floating on top of the waves
wrapped in golden light, 
green as always.
